                         SANTA CLAUS’ FROLICS.

              A CHRISTMAS ENTERTAINMENT FOR LITTLE FOLKS.


                                -------

[_The rising of the curtain discloses room, with a fireplace_, C., _on
  either side or above which are hung stockings of various sizes, from
  the baby’s little sock to Bridget’s long and broad red, blue, or
  black hose. On the right of the fireplace is the Christmas tree,
  hidden by a curtain, which is so arranged that it may be easily
  removed (or, if double parlors are used, or the entertainment is
  given in a hall or vestry, the tree can be placed in one corner of
  the audience-room, and while the attention of the auditors is
  diverted by the entertainment in the other room, or upon the
  platform, the tree can be lighted). Six or eight children in the
  scene, arrayed in night dresses and caps, with lighted candles in
  their hands, moving about, and occasionally looking up chimney._]


                   SONG.—Air, “_We’re all Noddin’_.”

_Girls._

We’re all waiting, wait, wait, waiting,
We’re all waiting for Santa Claus to come.
To catch him we’re waiting; he’ll surely be here;
The moments fly quickly, and midnight draws near.

_All._

We’re all waiting, wait, wait, waiting,
We’re all waiting for Santa Claus to come.

_Boys._

We’re all freezing, freeze, freeze, freezing,
We’re all freezing, here, waiting in the cold;
For Santa to bring us our presents we wait;
Come, hurry, old fellow; ’tis really quite late.

_All._

We’re all freezing, freeze, freeze, freezing,
We’re all freezing, here, waiting in the cold.

_Girls._

We’re all nodding, nod, nod, nodding,
We’re all nodding, and dropping off to sleep;
To our warm little beds ’tis time we should go;
Come, hurry, good Santa; pray don’t be so slow.

_All._

For we’re all nodding, nod, nod, nodding,
For we’re all nodding, and dropping off to sleep.

_Boys._

We’re all yawning, yaw, yaw, yawning,
We’re all yawning; so let’s go off to bed.

_Girls._

To stay any longer we’re surely unwise;
We’ll wait for the daylight to open our eyes.

_All._

For we’re all yawning, yaw, yaw, yawning,
We’re all yawning, and going off to bed.

  [_Exeunt_, R. _and_ L., _repeating the last two lines_.


_Santa Claus peeps out from chimney, then enters. Costume, rubber
  boots, with pants tucked into them; heavy fur coat, with red
  comforter tied about it; red comforter about his neck; peaked fur
  cap; long gray hair and beard; very red face; strapped to his back a
  large basket, filled with toys._

_Santa_ (_looking_ R. _and_ L.).

Ho, ho, my little rogues. You set a trap
To catch me napping; _now_ who takes the nap?
I’m an old schemer; even your sharp eyes
Could never find me in this queer disguise.
Dream on, my darlings, while I treasures heap.
Ho, ho! to fill your _hose_ while you’re asleep.
Year after year, I drop in on the sly,
Through chimneys made for me so broad and high;
To pop down them is made my cheerful duty;
It _suits_ me too—sometimes, almost too _sooty_.

(_Takes basket off back._)

Let’s see: what year is this? why bless my eyes,
It’s 1872.—Good Gracious! how time flies!
And children multiply so fast, ’tis clear,
A partner I must have another year.
I’m really getting old. This wrinkled phiz
Of good old age a striking symbol is.
And yet I’m strong, can frolic, dance, or play
With young folks yet for many a Christmas day.
So I’ll not grumble; while I can, I’ll strive
To let my boys and girls know I’m alive.
What though my hair is gray, my heart is young,
And green as Christmas boughs around me hung.


               SONG.—Santa Claus. Air, “_Captain Jinks_.”

I’m Santa Claus, the Christmas king,
And every year I gayly sing,
Ho, boys and girls, to you I bring
Such lots of Christmas Presents;
A clipper sled, for merry Ned,
For merry Ned, for merry Ned,
A waxen doll, for pretty Poll,
You’ll find among my treasures.

(_Spoken._) But, bless you, I don’t sing very loud, for I know that
“Little pitchers have big ears,” and I wouldn’t have them hear me for
the world. Ah, many and many a time I’ve heard a soft voice in the
middle of the night, cry out, “Who’s there?” Ah, ha! Then I creep about
softly, and sing very low,—

I’m Santa Claus, &c.

The boys and girls in me delight,
In me delight, in me delight;
They hang their stockings in the night
To wait my midnight coming.
With generous store I fill them all,
I fill them all, I fill them all;
With generous store I fill them all,
And creep off in the morning.

(_Spoken._) For, bless the dear little rogues, they’re only half
asleep. Wouldn’t they like to catch me! But no, no, I’m away up the
chimney, and when morning comes I peep in, and hear them cry, “Why, who
has been here, and left these beautiful presents?” Ah, ha! then I
sing,—

Why, Santa Claus, the Christmas king,
Who every year doth gayly sing, &c.

(_Children sing outside._)

We’re all dreaming, dream, dream, dreaming,
We’re all dreaming that Santa Claus has come.

_Santa._

Dream on, my darlings, unto each of you
Morn shall bring joy; your dreams shall all be true.
Here are the stockings; bless me, what a row!
Little and big, they make a wondrous show.

(_As he speaks he fills stockings._)

First comes the baby’s; what a tiny thing!
’Twill just hold a rattle and a rubber ring;
This is a girl’s, so very neat and small;
I’ll stuff it with candy, and a pretty doll.
Ah! here’s a boy’s. It’s very strong and blue.
A nice new pair of skates, my lad, for you;
Another girl’s. What can I find to please her?
Ah, here’s a tea set; don’t think that’s a _teaser_.
Another boy’s! Ho, this will never do,—
Hole in the heel; a present would drop through;
A ball of yarn will make him wiser grow;
’Twill mend his stocking and his habits too.
What monster’s this? It must be Bridget’s, sure;
’Twould hold all I have brought, I fear much more.
A nice new gingham dress—a good warm shawl—
Don’t fill it—then here goes a waterfall.

And now I’m off. (_Sees audience._) Hallo! whom have we here?

I really am found out; that’s very clear.
Now don’t expose me, for I did not mean
Upon my annual visit to be seen.
If you are all my children, ’tis not fair
To tell my secrets even to the air;
So keep them close; don’t whisper I’ve been here;
And shut your eyes; I’m going to disappear.
With “Merry Christmas” wishes all I greet,
Hoping next year my visit to repeat.
And now good night—I’m off. Yet ere I go,
A little magic I propose to show.
Shut fast your eyes a minute—one, two, three.
Presto! change! Behold the Christmas tree.

(_The Christmas tree is suddenly disclosed. Santa Claus approaches it,
and distributes presents._)
